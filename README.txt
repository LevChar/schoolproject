Notes:
- When both player positioning a piece in the same cell then it will show up and they will know which piece is there however the fight will be done after all pieces are inserted from console.
- Every Input from the player should be without issues and as requested.
- Assuming we cannot move joker and change his form on the same time.

Fixed:
- Move more then once cell.
- Move Across
- Stand in one place.
- Player cant put two pieces in the same cell.
- No more warnnings.

Bugs:
- Show-only-known-info and show-player are not working properly.
- Even though there was a fight and someone won the presentiation will still not be shown.
- When we are trying to change a presentiation of piece which is not Joker the game does not end [FILE Game]
