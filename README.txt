# Notes:

- When both player positioning a piece in the same cell then it will show up and they will know which piece is thereת
 however the fight will be done after all pieces are inserted from console.
 
- Every Input from the player should be without issues and as requested.

- Assuming we cannot move joker and change his form on the same time.


# Fixed:

- Move more then once cellץ
- Move Across in diagonal way.
- Stand in one place.
- Player cant put two pieces in the same cell.
- No more warnnings.
- show <player> working properly
- When we are trying to change a presentiation of piece which is not Joker the game does not end [FILE Game]

# Bugs:
- Show-only-known-info is not working properly.
- Even though there was a fight and someone won the presentiation will still not be shown.
- some input problems in the console.
