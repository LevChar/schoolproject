Notes:
- When both player positioning a piece in the same cell then it will show up and they will know which piece is there however the fight will be done after all pieces are inserted from console.
- Every Input from the player should be without issues and as requested.
- Assuming we cannot move joker and change his form on the same time.

Fixed:
- Move more then once cell.
- Move Across
- Stand in one place.
- Player cant put two pieces in the same cell.
- No more warnnings.

Bugs:
- Show-only-known-info and show-player are not working properly.
- Even though there was a fight and someone won the presentiation will still not be shown.
- Close of files is not being performed on all cases. ~~
- ifndef i snot verfied and properly set (we are doing includes in CPP). ~~~~
- Static const is being used in CPP. ~~~~

TESTS:
5. To check input (File and Console) where we want to change Joker presentiation however there is no joker inside. ~
